# DIY Astigmatic Angle Determination
Experimental tool to determine the axis angles of your astigmatic eyes
                                                                                                    
# Warning:
This tool is by no means made with professional expertise!
You should use this out of curiosity only !!!

# Reason for making this tool:
I ordered new glasses (adapted for my computer screen, fixed distance 50cm), sadly it was useless to me.
I noticed I had to rotate my glasses to improve sight (for my left eye)
So I started experimenting.
I think I managed to determine the angles for both my eyes, I think pretty accurate.
My precribed cylinders are around -1,5.

# Control:
Launch by evaluating:   AADTAstigmaticAngleDeterminationTool run
Take a look at method: #processKeyDown: to learn about keyboard control keys.
Use your mouse wheel to zoom.

# Usage:
Occlude one eye and sit at the exact distance you want to work at.
(The astigmatic angle may vary with the distance between your eye and the screen).
If you have astigmatism, while looking at the full cirle fan, you should see one line (or two lines) as the sharpest.
Using left/right keys, rotate until the center hair-line is inline with the sharpest line.
To get more accuracy, play with rotation, line thicknes, number of lines, zoom, colors, full mode versus few lines mode,
until lines adjacent to the sharpest line are equally sharp (or equally unsharp).
This requires some practice and concentration.
Using the T key, you can reveal the astigmatic angle that should correspond to the angle on your glasses prescription.
